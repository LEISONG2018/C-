For this project. I guess, if we use pointer to allocate dynamic memory, it will work well for passing by value directly. Because in the constructor, we use char* as parameters.
But if we want to pass between objects, it doesn't work. There are no constuctor for initialization and member function for pass by reference. 
And when we want to pass the objects with pointer, we do need to delete str first. If we don't, we may meet memory leak. 
Because the memory still be allocated, we just change pointer to another memory.
